## How to start your challenge

This is a Universal Starter for all the Basic INVO Academy Challenges. In order to start your challenge, remove all the content inside `<div id="home-page"></div>` and start coding :)

The main file structure is prepered, please make yourslef familiar with it. Your goal is to explore it and extend on your own while development. Feel free to remove all the extra files and code that you don't need.

## How to run your project

If you run your this project for the first time, you need to install npm dependencies by typing

`npm install` (this is for the one-time installation only)

In order to run your project in a development mode type

`npm run dev`

then open your browser and go to the url showed in the terminal. That's it, if you make any changes in the code, browser will synchronize automatically.

## Building your project

When you are ready to put your project on the Internet, you need to build it. For building, type

`npm run build`

This commend will create a dist folder. This is the folder containing your whole application and that's the only folder that you need to deploy to the server in order to make your app publically available.

## More informations about folder structure and deploying your application you can find inside INVO Academy Knowledge Base

DESCRIPTION OF A TASK

Brief
The aim of the task is to code a 3-column layout of tiles on the page. All tiles have the same layout of elements inside, so the final result should be one codebase with appropriate modifiers.

To complete the task, use the starter code provided in the asset package, and utilize the SCSS preprocessor for styling.

The final project should meet the following requirements:

Tiles should be able to accommodate any length of text in the description
If one of the boxes has longer text than the others, on the desktop version, all tiles should be aligned by height to the longest one. For the mobile version, each tile should have a height consistent with the length of the text
All links should be clickable but not redirect to any page. It is a good practice to use <a href='#'></a>
The page should be displayed correctly on any device type (remember to test responsiveness for all resolutions and on a physical mobile device)
The page should have properly handled interactive elements such as links or buttons (users should feel that something happens when they interact with the element)
Remember that both the visual effect and the cleanliness of the code will be important when assessing the task. Good luck!
